 <h6 class="name SECOND CITIZEN">SECOND CITIZEN</h6>
 
    <p class="speech">Good morrow, neighbour Dominick.</p>
 
 <h6 class="name FIRST CITIZEN">FIRST CITIZEN</h6>
 
    <p class="speech">This is a strange day for Padua, is it not?—the Duke being dead.</p>
 
 <h6 class="name SECOND CITIZEN">SECOND CITIZEN</h6> 

    <p class="speech">tell you, neighbour Dominick, I have not known such a day since the
        last Duke died.</p>
 
 <h6 class="name FIRST CITIZEN">FIRST CITIZEN</h6>
 
    <p class="speech">They will try him first, and sentence him afterwards, will they not,
        neighbour Anthony?</p>
 
 <h6 class="name SECOND CITIZEN">SECOND CITIZEN</h6>
 
    <p class="speech"> Nay, for he might ’scape his punishment then; but they will condemn
        him first so that he gets his deserts, and give him trial afterwards
        so that no injustice is done.</p>

 <h6 class="name FIRST CITIZEN">FIRST CITIZEN</h6>
  
    <p class="speech">Well, well, it will go hard with him I doubt not.</p>
 
 <h6 class="name SECOND CITIZEN">SECOND CITIZEN</h6>
 
    <p class="speech">Surely it is a grievous thing to shed a Duke’s blood.</p>
 
 <h6 class="name THIRD CITIZEN">THIRD CITIZEN</h6>
 
    <p class="speech">They say a Duke has blue blood.</p>
 
 <h6 class="name SECOND CITIZEN">SECOND CITIZEN</h6>
 
    <p class="speech">I think our Duke’s blood was black like his soul.</p>
 
 <h6 class="name FIRST CITIZEN">FIRST CITIZEN</h6>
 
    <p class="speech">Have a watch, neighbour Anthony, the officer is looking at thee</p>
 
 <h6 class="name SECOND CITIZEN">SECOND CITIZEN</h6>
 
    <p class="speech">I care not if he does but look at me; he cannot whip me with the
        lashes of his eye.</p>
 
 <h6 class="name THIRD CITIZEN">THIRD CITIZEN</h6>
 
    <p class="speech">What think you of this young man who stuck the knife into the Duke?</p>
 
 <h6 class="name SECOND CITIZEN">SECOND CITIZEN</h6>
 
    <p class="speech">Why, that <p class="stage_directions">[he is a well-behaved],</p> and a well-meaning, and a
        well-favoured lad, and yet wicked in that he killed the Duke.</p>
 
 <h6 class="name THIRD CITIZEN">THIRD CITIZEN</h6>
 
  <p class="stage_directions">[’Twas the first time he did it:]</p> <p class="speech"> may be the law will not be hard on
    him, as he did not do it before.</p> 
 
 <h6 class="name SECOND CITIZEN">SECOND CITIZEN</h6>
 
   <p class="speech">True.</p>
 
 <h6 class="name TIPSTAFF">TIPSTAFF</h6>
 
   <p class="speech"> Silence, knave.</p>
 
 <h6 class="name SECOND CITIZEN"> SECOND CITIZEN</h6>
 
   <p class="speech"> Am I thy looking-glass, Master Tipstaff, that thou callest me knave?</p>
 
 <h6 class="name FIRST CITIZEN">FIRST CITIZEN</h6>
 
   <p class="speech"> Here be one of the household coming.  Well, Dame Lucy, thou art of the
    Court, how does thy poor mistress the Duchess, with her sweet face?</p>
 
<h6 class="name MISTRESS"> MISTRESS LUCY</h6>
 
   <p class="speech"> O well-a-day!  O miserable day!  O day!  O misery!  Why it is just
    nineteen years last June, at Michaelmas, since I was married to my
    husband, and it is August now, and here is the Duke murdered; there is
    a coincidence for you!</p>
