<h2>The Duchess of Padua</h2>
<h3>ACT IV._The Hall of Justice_ (31 _minutes_).</h3>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN

    Good morrow, neighbour Anthony.
 
 SECOND CITIZEN
 
    Good morrow, neighbour Dominick.
 
 FIRST CITIZEN
 
    This is a strange day for Padua, is it not?—the Duke being dead.
 
 SECOND CITIZEN
 
    I tell you, neighbour Dominick, I have not known such a day since the
    last Duke died.
 
 FIRST CITIZEN
 
    They will try him first, and sentence him afterwards, will they not,
    neighbour Anthony?
 
 SECOND CITIZEN
 
    Nay, for he might ’scape his punishment then; but they will condemn
    him first so that he gets his deserts, and give him trial afterwards
    so that no injustice is done.
 
 FIRST CITIZEN
 
    Well, well, it will go hard with him I doubt not.
 
 SECOND CITIZEN
 
    Surely it is a grievous thing to shed a Duke’s blood.
 
 THIRD CITIZEN
 
    They say a Duke has blue blood.
 
 SECOND CITIZEN
 
    I think our Duke’s blood was black like his soul.
 
 FIRST CITIZEN
 
    Have a watch, neighbour Anthony, the officer is looking at thee.
 
 SECOND CITIZEN
 
    I care not if he does but look at me; he cannot whip me with the
    lashes of his eye.
 
 THIRD CITIZEN
 
    What think you of this young man who stuck the knife into the Duke?
 
 SECOND CITIZEN
 
    Why, that he is a well-behaved, and a well-meaning, and a
    well-favoured lad, and yet wicked in that he killed the Duke.
 
 THIRD CITIZEN
 
    ’Twas the first time he did it: may be the law will not be hard on
    him, as he did not do it before.
 
 SECOND CITIZEN
 
    True.
 
 TIPSTAFF
 
    Silence, knave.
 
 SECOND CITIZEN
 
    Am I thy looking-glass, Master Tipstaff, that thou callest me knave?
 
 FIRST CITIZEN
 
    Here be one of the household coming.  Well, Dame Lucy, thou art of the
    Court, how does thy poor mistress the Duchess, with her sweet face?
 
 MISTRESS LUCY
 
    O well-a-day!  O miserable day!  O day!  O misery!  Why it is just
    nineteen years last June, at Michaelmas, since I was married to my
    husband, and it is August now, and here is the Duke murdered; there is
    a coincidence for you!
 
 SECOND CITIZEN
 
    Why, if it is a coincidence, they may not kill the young man: there is
    no law against coincidences.
